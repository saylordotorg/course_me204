Heat transfer is the thermal energy in transit due to a spatial
temperature difference. The topic of heat transfer has enormous
applications in mechanical engineering, ranging from cooling of
microelectronics to design of jet engines and operations of nuclear
power plants. In this course, you will learn about what heat transfer
is, what governs the rate of heat transfer, and why heat transfer is so
important. You will also learn about the three major modes of heat
transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation.  Heat conduction is the
transport of heat through a solid body, by vibrations of molecules or in
the case of electrical conductors, by movement of electrons from one
molecule to another. Heat convection is a process by which heat is
transferred through a fluid by motion of fluid. Thermal radiation is the
transport of energy between two bodies by electromagnetic waves. In
addition to the three main modes of heat transfer, you will also learn
about heat transfer during phase changes (boiling and condensation heat
transfer).

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Formulate basic equation for heat transfer problems.
-   Apply heat transfer principles to design and to evaluate performance
    of thermal systems.
-   Solve differential and algebraic equations associated with thermal
    systems using analytical and numerical approaches.
-   Calculate the performance of heat exchangers.
-   Calculate radiation heat transfer between objects with simple
    geometries.
-   Calculate and evaluate the impacts of initial and boundary
    conditions on the solutions of a particular heat transfer problem.
-   Evaluate the relative contributions of different modes of heat
    transfer.

### Course Information

Welcome to ME204.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Tuan Dinh

**Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   MIT: Professors John Lienhard IV and John Lienhard V’s *[A Heat
    Transfer Textbook](http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/ahtt.html)*
-   YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay: Professor
    S.P.Sukhatme and Professor U.N.Gaitonde’s [Video
    Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa-PQOjS3zA)
-   MIT: Professor Z. S. Spakovszky’sLecture Notes on [Thermodynamics
    and
    Propulsion](http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/SPRING/propulsion/notes/node5.html)

You may also find the following tables resourceful as you work through
the materials in this course:

-   MIT Opencourseware: [Intermediate Heat and Mass
    Transfer](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-51-intermediate-heat-and-mass-transfer-fall-2008/study-materials/):
    “Selected Physical Constants” and “Selected Conversion Factors”\*

Make sure to click on each “PDF” link in the Study Materials section to
download these tables.

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units.  You will also need to complete:

-   Unit 1 Quiz
-   Unit 2 Quiz
-   Unit 3 Quiz
-   Unit 4 Quiz
-   Unit 5 Quiz
-   Unit 6 Quiz
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources in each unit.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again. 

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **112
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 8 hours.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete half of the Unit 1
reading (about 2 hours) on Monday night; the remainder of the Unit 1
reading (about 2 hours) on Tuesday night; the Unit 1 lecture on
Wednesday night; etc. 

**Tips/Suggestions**: As noted in the “Course Requirements,”
multi-variate calculus is a pre-requisite for this course.  If you are
struggling with the mathematics as you progress through this course,
consider taking a break to revisit
[MA103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma103/), focusing especially
on Units 3 and 4. 

It will likely be helpful to have a graphing calculator on hand for this
course. If you do not own or have access to one, consider using [this
freeware version.\*](http://www.graphcalc.com/)

As you read, take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.  Mark down
any important equations, formulas, and definitions that stand out to
you. It will be useful to use this “cheat sheet” as a review prior to
completing the final exam. You may want to familiarize yourself with the
tables of Selected Physical Constants and Selected Conversion Factors,
linked under the Primary Resources heading, as they will prove to be
useful during the course.
