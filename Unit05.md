**Unit 5: Radiation** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the third mode of heat transfer:
radiation.  Unlike conduction (Unit 2) and convection (Unit 3), thermal
radiation does not require matter to act as its medium of transference. 
In this unit, we will first look at the basic terminology and
fundamental equations of radiation.  You will first be introduced to
blackbody radiation heat transfer and then move onto how to calculate
exchange of radiative energy between two surfaces.*
