**Unit 1: Introduction to Heat Transfer** <span id="1"></span> 
*This first unit will introduce you to the subject of heat transfer. 
Mechanical engineers use the knowledge about heat transfer to solve many
real-world problems from maintaining house temperature at a comfortable
level to making fuel rods in nuclear reactors not overheated.  We will
discuss three basic methods of heat motion: convection, conduction, and
radiation.  In this section, we will also explore the similarities
between heat transfer and thermodynamics.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

☐    Video Lecture: 1 hour

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define different modes of heat transfers.
-   Derive energy conservation equations for a control volume and a
    control surface.

     Instructions: Please click on the link “Download *A Heat Transfer
    Textbook,*” which will take you to a download request form.  After
    you fill in relevant information about you, you will be able to
    download the book.  Note that the only information required on the
    form is your city, country, and occupation.  The book is in PDF
    format (17.2 MB).  Save a copy of the book for future use.  This is
    one of the best books on heat transfer.  For this unit, please read
    “Chapter 1: Introduction” (page 3-35).  The reading discusses the
    applications of heat transfer in everyday life (section 1.1), the
    relationship between the first law of thermodynamics and heat
    transfer (section 1.2), as well as different modes of heat transfer
    (section 1.3).  You may simply browse this reading. Note that the
    reading will cover the material that you need to know for
    all subunits in Unit 1.

     Instructions: Please watch these videos (about 50-54 minutes for
    each video), which will introduce you to the basic concepts of heat
    transfer.  The videos will cover the material that you need to know
    for Unit 1.  In Lecture 1, pay attention to the discussion on the
    distinction between heat transfer and thermodynamics at the 8:00
    minute mark.  Compare how Professor S.P. Sukhatme defined heat
    transfer and sections 1.1 and 1.2 in the Lienhard-Lienhard textbook.
     Lecuture 2 introduced the concepts of control volume and the
    derivation of first law of thermodynamics for a control volume.
     Lecture 3 introduced you to the three modes of heat transfer:
    conduction, convection, and radiation.  This lecture reinforces what
    you learned from section 1.3 of the Lienhard-Lienhard textbook.
