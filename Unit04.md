**Unit 4: Heat Exchangers** <span id="4"></span> 
*Heat exchangers are devices designed to transfer energy from one fluid
to another.  You can find heat exchangers in almost any engineering
application, ranging from nuclear power plant to the cooling of
electronic devices.  Heat exchanges can be found in a wide variety of
configurations, but can be generally classified into three basic types:
the parallel or counter-flow configuration, the shell-and-tube
configuration, and the cross-flow configuration.  In this unit, you will
learn about the pros and cons and how to evaluate performance of each
configuration.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 14 hours to complete.

     Instructions: For this unit, please read “Chapter 3: Heat Exchanger
    Design” (pp. 99-129), which will introduce you to heat exchangers. 
    You will also learn about some basic considerations when designing
    heat exchangers.  Practice “Experiment 1” on page 101.  Make sure
    you know how to calculate logarithmistic mean temperature difference
    (LMTD), which is critical for evaluating performance of heat
    transfer coefficient.
