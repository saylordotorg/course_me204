**Unit 2: Conduction** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this Unit, you will be introduced to heat conduction, which is the
primary mode of heat transfer in solid systems.  Heat conduction occurs
when there is temperature gradient in the system and involves transfer
of thermal energy from regions with higher temperature (higher molecular
kinetic energy) to regions with lower temperature (lower molecular
kinetic energy) by collisions of molecules and interactions of
electrons.  The process of heat conduction plays a vital role in many
engineering systems, ranging from metal casting, cooling of
microelectronic devices, to dissipation of energy generated by nuclear
fuel.  
    
 In this Unit, you will learn about the basic concepts and equations of
heat conduction and how to obtain solutions for heat conduction problems
in simple geometric configurations.*

    conduction is an example of one-dimensional, steady-state

    analysis to determine the amount of heat is conducted between the
    cool air inside and the hot air outdoor through the wall.  Note that
