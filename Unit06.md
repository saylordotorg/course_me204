**Unit 6: Boiling and Condensation** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this final Unit of the course, we will turn our attention back to
heat conduction and convection and study their roles in boiling and
condensation.  Heat transfer in boiling and condensation is very complex
but of considerable technical importance.  You will learn about
different boiling regimes (including nucleate boiling, film boiling, and
critical heat flux) as well as different condensation modes (including
film condensation and dropwise condensation).  You will need to use what
you learned in Units 2 and 3 to derive the equations for boiling and
condensation heat transfer.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 28 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please click on the links to the videos for Lectures
    29-32 and watch them in their entirety.  Each will last about an
    hour.  The videos will introduce you to the basic concepts and
    governing equations of heat transfer during boiling and
    condensation.  You will also learn to apply these equations to solve
    several basic boiling and condensation heat transfer problems. Note
    that the video lectures will cover the material that you need to
    know for subunits 6.1-6.8.
