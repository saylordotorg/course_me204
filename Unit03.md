**Unit 3: Convection** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the second mode of heat transfer:
convection.  While conduction is the major mode of heat transfer in
solids (as you learned in Unit 2), convection is the major mode of heat
transfer in fluids.  Convection occurs because of movements of fluids.
 Heat is carried away and dispersed thorough the fluid.  Convective heat
transfer occurs in nature (e.g. cooling down effects of wind) and in
engineering systems (e.g. heating of homes, cooling of equipment).  
  
 We will examine two major types of convective heat transfer: forced
convection and natural convection.  In forced convection, movement of
fluid is due to external forces such as a pump, while in natural
convection, it is due to density differences driven by non-uniformity of
temperature. *
